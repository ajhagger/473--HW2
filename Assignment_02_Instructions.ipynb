    "Sparse matrices which contain many zeros are extremely useful in certain applications.  For example, a large graph such as a social network can be represented by an [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) in which the matrix value of the $i,j$-th element is 1 if and only if there is a connection between person $i$ and person $j$.  Suppose you are modeling a million people.  While the matrix is 1 million by 1 million, each person is only connected to maybe a few thousand other people.  Thus, the total number of entries is $(10^6)^2 = 10^{12}$ but the number of nonzeros is only $10^6 \\times 1000 = 10^9$.  Thus, the memory savings alone is on the order of $1000$.  Additionally, matrix vector multiplications are significantly faster for very sparse matrices. The internal format of sparse matrices is outside the scope of this exercise but you can find more details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix."
